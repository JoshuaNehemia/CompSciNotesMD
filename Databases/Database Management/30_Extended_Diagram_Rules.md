# ERD Rules – Identification Dependency and Redundant Foreign Keys

---

## Opening Question: What Kind of Errors About Identification Dependency Cannot Be Detected by Diagram Rules?

Diagram rules can identify errors in **notation** but **cannot determine the appropriateness** of identification dependency in a given business context. Specifically:

1. **Correct Usage of Identification Dependency**:
   - The rules cannot assess whether the **weak entity type** and its **identifying relationships** are necessary or align with business requirements.
   - Example:
     - Diagram rules may flag no issues, but the choice to use a weak entity type (e.g., `Room` relying on `Building`) might not match real-world needs if rooms can exist independently (e.g., in modular setups).

2. **Semantic Representation**:
   - Rules cannot verify if the **relationship cardinalities** or structure accurately reflect real-world scenarios.

### Conclusion:
While diagram rules ensure **notation correctness**, the appropriateness of modeling identification dependency must be validated based on **business requirements**, a subject covered in Modules 8 and 9.

## Lesson Objectives

1. Apply **diagram rules** to avoid notational errors in identification dependency, relationships, and foreign keys.
2. Eliminate **redundant foreign keys** in ERDs to maintain simplicity.
3. Reflect on the limitations of diagram rules, recognizing where judgment and business analysis are necessary.

## Key Rules for Identification Dependency

### Core Diagram Rules for Identification Dependency

1. **Weak Entity Type Rule**:
   - A weak entity type must participate in one or more identifying relationships.

2. **Identifying Relationship Rule**:
   - Identifying relationships must connect a weak entity type to a parent entity type.

3. **Cardinality Rule for Identification Dependency**:
   - Minimum and maximum cardinalities from the weak entity type to the parent must both be **1**.

### Example ERD Errors and Corrections

#### Incorrect ERD:
1. **Weak Entity Type Error**:
   - `Faculty` is designated as a weak entity type but lacks an identifying relationship.
2. **Relationship Error**:
   - The `Has` relationship connects two regular entity types (`Offering` and `Course`) but is incorrectly marked as identifying.
3. **Cardinality Error**:
   - In `Registers`, the cardinality from the weak entity (`Enrollment`) to the parent (`Student`) is incorrect (not **1:1**).

#### Corrected ERD:
- `Faculty` reclassified as a **regular entity type**, removing its weak dependency.
- `Has` relationship marked as **non-identifying**, matching regular entities.
- `Registers` relationship corrected to show **1:1 cardinality** near `Student` and **0:M cardinality** near `Enrollment`.

## Redundant Foreign Keys

### Definition:
- Foreign keys, while necessary in relational database diagrams, are **redundant** in ERDs due to the presence of named relationships.

### Detection:
1. Look for attributes in a child entity type (on the **many** side of a relationship) that match the **primary key** in the parent entity type (on the **one** side).
2. Example:
   - In an ERD, `FacNo` in `Offering` matches `FacNo` in `Faculty`.
   - The attribute is redundant because the `Teaches` relationship already links `Faculty` and `Offering`.

### Using Tools:
- The **ER Assistant**:
  - Highlights redundant foreign keys based on matching attribute names and data types.
  - Example:
    - After running the **check diagram** tool, `FacNo` in `Offering` is flagged as redundant.

## Addressing Errors with Diagram Rules

While diagram rules help ensure consistency, correctness often depends on **business requirements**:

1. **Weak Entity Types**:
   - Adding or removing identifying relationships depends on real-world dependencies.
   - Example:
     - If `Room` can exist independently of `Building`, it should be reclassified as a regular entity type.

2. **Cardinality Adjustments**:
   - Cardinalities must reflect business constraints.
   - Example:
     - The `Registers` relationship must correctly enforce that every `Enrollment` corresponds to exactly one `Student`.

3. **Redundant Foreign Keys**:
   - Removal simplifies the ERD without losing any meaningful information.

## Limitations of Diagram Rules

1. **Understanding Business Context**:
   - Rules do not evaluate the **necessity** of weak entity types or identifying relationships.
   - Example:
     - A business scenario may not justify a weak entity type, but diagram rules cannot assess this.

2. **Semantic Validation**:
   - Rules cannot verify whether relationships and attributes capture the intended real-world meaning.

3. **Ambiguity in Requirements**:
   - If business requirements are unclear or incomplete, the ERD may comply with diagram rules but fail to meet organizational needs.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Diagram Rules for Identification Dependency**:
   - Ensure weak entity types, identifying relationships, and cardinalities are correctly represented.
   - Use tools like the **ER Assistant** to automate error detection.

2. **Redundant Foreign Keys**:
   - Remove redundant attributes in child entity types to maintain simplicity in ERDs.

3. **Limits of Diagram Rules**:
   - Rules validate **notation**, but semantic correctness and alignment with business requirements require human judgment.

With these skills, you’re now equipped to identify and correct notational issues in ERDs. The next lessons will focus on **problem-solving**, where you’ll apply these rules in creating and refining ERDs based on narrative descriptions. This sets the stage for addressing more nuanced challenges in Modules 8 and 9.
