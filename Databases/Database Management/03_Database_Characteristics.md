# Database Characteristics  

## Why Databases Matter  
Databases play a crucial role in supporting company operations and decision-making. To manage and organize vast amounts of data, a **Database Management System (DBMS)** is required. A DBMS provides the foundation for handling the long-term memory of organizations, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and processing.  

### The Data Challenge  
Modern organizations generate an overwhelming amount of data, often referred to as a **flood of data**. Managing this data efficiently is essential for business success.  

### What is Data?  
Data consists of **raw facts** or **events** that, when processed, become meaningful information.  

#### Two Main Types of Data  
1. **Conventional Data** – Typically structured and text-based information found in everyday business operations, such as:  
   - Name  
   - Address  
   - Date of Birth (DOB)  

2. **Unconventional Data** – Includes multimedia and other complex formats, such as:  
   - Digital media  
   - Images  
   - Maps  
   - Drawings  
   - Videos  
   - Web pages  
   - Fingerprints  

### Purpose of Databases  
The primary goal of database management is to transform raw data into **useful information** that aids decision-making.  

## Essential Characteristics of a Database  
For a database to effectively support business operations, it must have three key characteristics:  

1. **Persistence**  
   - Data is stored for the long term.  
   - Organizations require reliable memory to retain historical records.  

2. **Inter-related Data**  
   - Businesses must maintain relationships between different data entities.  
   - **What is an entity?**  
     - An entity represents a real-world object or concept stored in a database, such as a customer, product, or order.  

3. **Shared Access**  
   - A single database can be used by multiple applications and users simultaneously.  
   - Ensures consistency and efficiency across business operations.  

## Understanding Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)  
A **diagram that depicts relationships between entities** is called an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.  
- ERDs visually represent how data entities interact.  
- Though complex, they must be carefully **planned and designed** to ensure accuracy and efficiency.
