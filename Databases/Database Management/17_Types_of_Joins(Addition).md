## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore how to use **join operations** in SQL `SELECT` statements to combine data from multiple tables. We'll focus on two different styles of writing join operations:

1. **Cross Product Style (Implicit Join)**
2. **Join Operator Style (Explicit Join)**

Understanding these styles will enhance your ability to formulate queries that retrieve data from multiple related tables, a fundamental skill in SQL.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Write `SELECT` statements using both the cross product style and the join operator style.
- Provide natural language explanations to document `SELECT` statements containing both join styles.
- Understand the importance of database relationships when formulating queries involving joins.

---

## Understanding the Database Relationships

We'll continue using the **university database** introduced in earlier modules. Familiarity with the database schema is crucial when formulating queries involving joins.

**Key Tables and Their Relationships**:

- **Faculty** (`Faculty`)
  - **FacNo** (Primary Key)
- **Offering** (`Offering`)
  - **OfferNo** (Primary Key)
  - **FacNo** (Foreign Key referencing `Faculty.FacNo`)
  - **CourseNo**
- **Course** (`Course`)
  - **CourseNo** (Primary Key)

**Relationships**:

- **Faculty** and **Offering** tables are joined on **FacNo**.
- **Offering** and **Course** tables are joined on **CourseNo**.

---

## Styles of Writing Join Operations

### Cross Product Style (Implicit Join)

- **Description**: Lists tables in the `FROM` clause and specifies join conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Easier to read for some due to the straightforward listing of tables.
  - All tables involved are clearly listed in the `FROM` clause.
  - Join conditions are specified in the `WHERE` clause.

### Join Operator Style (Explicit Join)

- **Description**: Uses `JOIN` keywords and specifies join conditions using `ON`.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Makes the join conditions an explicit part of the `FROM` clause.
  - Can be more verbose but ensures that join conditions are not omitted.
  - Supports advanced join types like `LEFT JOIN`, `RIGHT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

---

## Examples of Join Operations

### Example 1: Cross Product Style with Two Tables

**Scenario**: Retrieve the `OfferNo`, `CourseNo`, `FacFirstName`, and `FacLastName` for assistant professors teaching Information Systems courses (course numbers starting with `'IS'`) offered in Fall 2019.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName
FROM Offering, Faculty
WHERE Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
  AND FacRank = 'ASSISTANT'
  AND CourseNo LIKE 'IS%'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

**Explanation**:

- **FROM Clause**: Lists `Offering` and `Faculty` tables.
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - `Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo`: Join condition matching faculty members to offerings.
  - Additional conditions filter for assistant professors teaching specific courses in Fall 2019.

### Example 2: Join Operator Style with Two Tables

**Scenario**: Same as Example 1 but using the join operator style.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName
FROM Offering
INNER JOIN Faculty ON Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
WHERE FacRank = 'ASSISTANT'
  AND CourseNo LIKE 'IS%'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

**Explanation**:

- **FROM Clause**:
  - Uses `INNER JOIN` to explicitly join `Offering` and `Faculty` on `FacNo`.
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Contains only the filtering conditions.
- **Result**:
  - Identical to Example 1.

### Example 3: Cross Product Style with Three Tables

**Scenario**: List details about **Leonard Vince's** teaching schedule in Fall 2019.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, OffTerm, OffYear
FROM Offering, Faculty, Course
WHERE Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
  AND Offering.CourseNo = Course.CourseNo
  AND FacFirstName = 'Leonard'
  AND FacLastName = 'Vince'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

**Explanation**:

- **FROM Clause**: Lists `Offering`, `Faculty`, and `Course` tables.
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Contains two join conditions:
    - `Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo`
    - `Offering.CourseNo = Course.CourseNo`
  - Filters for courses taught by Leonard Vince in Fall 2019.

**Note**:

- With three tables, there should be **N - 1** join conditions (here, 3 - 1 = 2 join conditions).
- Omitting a join condition can lead to incorrect results and performance issues.

### Example 4: Join Operator Style with Three Tables

**Scenario**: Same as Example 3 but using the join operator style.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, OffTerm, OffYear
FROM Offering
INNER JOIN Faculty ON Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
INNER JOIN Course ON Offering.CourseNo = Course.CourseNo
WHERE FacFirstName = 'Leonard'
  AND FacLastName = 'Vince'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

**Explanation**:

- **FROM Clause**:
  - Contains two `INNER JOIN` operations chaining the tables.
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Contains only the filtering conditions.
- **Result**:
  - Identical to Example 3.

---

## Name Qualification and Ambiguity

When combining multiple tables, column names might become **ambiguous** if they appear in more than one table. To resolve ambiguity, you should **qualify** column names with their table names.

**Example**:

- Ambiguous column: `FacNo` (exists in both `Offering` and `Faculty` tables).
- Qualified columns:
  - `Offering.FacNo`
  - `Faculty.FacNo`

**Reasons to Qualify Column Names**:

- **Clarity**: Makes it clear which table a column comes from.
- **Avoid Errors**: Prevents SQL interpreter errors due to ambiguity.
- **Maintenance**: Easier for others (and yourself) to read and understand the query later.

**Using Table Aliases**:

You can use **aliases** to make qualification shorter.

**Example**:

```sql
SELECT O.OfferNo, O.CourseNo, F.FacFirstName, F.FacLastName
FROM Offering AS O
INNER JOIN Faculty AS F ON O.FacNo = F.FacNo
WHERE F.FacRank = 'ASSISTANT'
  AND O.CourseNo LIKE 'IS%'
  AND O.OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND O.OffYear = 2019;
```

---

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Always Include Join Conditions**:
  - Omitting a join condition can create a **Cartesian product**, leading to incorrect results and performance issues.
- **Order of Tables and Conditions**:
  - The order in which tables are listed or conditions are specified doesn't affect the result.
  - The SQL optimizer determines the most efficient execution plan.
- **Use of Parentheses**:
  - Not necessary in join operations but can be used for clarity in complex joins.
- **Consistent Style**:
  - Choose a join style and use it consistently within your project or organization.
  - Ensure team members are familiar with both styles for better collaboration.
- **Understand the Database Schema**:
  - Knowledge of table relationships is essential for writing correct join conditions.
- **Qualifying Column Names**:
  - Helps avoid ambiguity.
  - Improves readability, especially in queries involving multiple tables.

## Introduction

In this lesson, we'll explore how to use **join operations** in SQL `SELECT` statements to combine data from multiple tables. Since databases often store related data in separate tables, understanding joins is crucial for querying and analyzing data effectively.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Write `SELECT` statements using both the cross product style and the join operator style.
- Understand and apply different types of joins, including inner join, natural join, left join, right join, full outer join, cross join, and self join.
- Provide explanations and examples for each type of join to deepen your understanding.

---

## Understanding the Database Relationships

We'll continue using the **university database** introduced earlier. Familiarity with the database schema is crucial when formulating queries involving joins.

**Key Tables and Their Relationships**:

- **Faculty** (`Faculty`)

  - **FacNo** (Primary Key)
  - **FacFirstName**
  - **FacLastName**
  - **FacRank**

- **Offering** (`Offering`)

  - **OfferNo** (Primary Key)
  - **CourseNo**
  - **FacNo** (Foreign Key referencing `Faculty.FacNo`)
  - **OffTerm**
  - **OffYear**

- **Course** (`Course`)

  - **CourseNo** (Primary Key)
  - **CourseName**

These relationships allow us to join tables on related columns to retrieve comprehensive data.

---

## Styles of Writing Join Operations

### Cross Product Style (Implicit Join)

- **Description**: Lists tables in the `FROM` clause and specifies join conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Characteristics**:

  - Simplistic and straightforward.
  - Join conditions are specified separately in the `WHERE` clause.

### Join Operator Style (Explicit Join)

- **Description**: Uses `JOIN` keywords (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, etc.) and specifies join conditions using `ON`.
- **Characteristics**:

  - More explicit and allows for clearer join conditions.
  - Supports various types of joins beyond inner joins.

---

## Examples of Join Operations

### Example 1: Cross Product Style with Two Tables

**Scenario**: Retrieve the `OfferNo`, `CourseNo`, `FacFirstName`, and `FacLastName` for assistant professors teaching Information Systems courses (course numbers starting with `'IS'`) offered in Fall 2019.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName
FROM Offering, Faculty
WHERE Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
  AND FacRank = 'ASSISTANT'
  AND CourseNo LIKE 'IS%'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

### Example 2: Join Operator Style with Two Tables

Same as Example 1 but using the join operator style.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, FacFirstName, FacLastName
FROM Offering
INNER JOIN Faculty ON Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
WHERE FacRank = 'ASSISTANT'
  AND CourseNo LIKE 'IS%'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

---

### Example 3: Cross Product Style with Three Tables

**Scenario**: List details about **Leonard Vince's** teaching schedule in Fall 2019.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, OffTerm, OffYear
FROM Offering, Faculty, Course
WHERE Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
  AND Offering.CourseNo = Course.CourseNo
  AND FacFirstName = 'Leonard'
  AND FacLastName = 'Vince'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

### Example 4: Join Operator Style with Three Tables

Same as Example 3 but using the join operator style.

```sql
SELECT OfferNo, CourseNo, OffTerm, OffYear
FROM Offering
INNER JOIN Faculty ON Offering.FacNo = Faculty.FacNo
INNER JOIN Course ON Offering.CourseNo = Course.CourseNo
WHERE FacFirstName = 'Leonard'
  AND FacLastName = 'Vince'
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019;
```

---

## Name Qualification and Ambiguity

When combining multiple tables, column names might become ambiguous if they appear in more than one table. To resolve ambiguity, qualify column names with their table names or use aliases.

**Example with Aliases**:

```sql
SELECT O.OfferNo, O.CourseNo, F.FacFirstName, F.FacLastName
FROM Offering AS O
INNER JOIN Faculty AS F ON O.FacNo = F.FacNo
WHERE F.FacRank = 'ASSISTANT'
  AND O.CourseNo LIKE 'IS%'
  AND O.OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND O.OffYear = 2019;
```

---

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Always Include Join Conditions**: Omitting them can lead to incorrect results and performance issues.
- **Be Consistent**: Choose a join style that suits your project's needs and stick with it.
- **Understand Your Data**: Knowledge of the database schema is crucial.
- **Use Aliases for Clarity**: Simplifies queries and improves readability.

## Additional Topic: In-Depth Look at Types of Joins in SQL

To deepen your understanding, let's explore various types of joins with emphasis on inner join, natural join, left join, and cross join.

### 1. Inner Join

#### Description

Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
INNER JOIN TableB ON TableA.CommonColumn = TableB.CommonColumn;
```

#### Example

Retrieve all students who have enrolled in courses.

```sql
SELECT S.StudNo, S.StudName, E.CourseNo
FROM Student AS S
INNER JOIN Enrollment AS E ON S.StudNo = E.StudNo;
```

#### Visualization

![Inner Join](https://i.imgur.com/5mFDUm3.png)

*Only records with matching values in both tables are included.*

---

### 2. Natural Join

#### Description

Automatically joins tables based on columns with the same name and data type, and removes duplicate columns.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
NATURAL JOIN TableB;
```

#### Example

Retrieve course offerings along with course details.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Offering
NATURAL JOIN Course;
```

#### Caution

- Use carefully, as unintended columns with the same name can affect results.
- Better for simple joins where you are certain of column names.

---

### 3. Left (Outer) Join

#### Description

Returns all records from the left table and matched records from the right table. Unmatched records from the right table are `NULL`.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
LEFT JOIN TableB ON TableA.CommonColumn = TableB.CommonColumn;
```

#### Example

Find all faculty members and any courses they are teaching.

```sql
SELECT F.FacNo, F.FacFirstName, F.FacLastName, O.CourseNo
FROM Faculty AS F
LEFT JOIN Offering AS O ON F.FacNo = O.FacNo;
```

#### Visualization

![Left Join](https://i.imgur.com/bbINcQS.png)

*All records from the left table are included, with `NULL` for no matches in the right table.*

---

### 4. Right (Outer) Join

#### Description

Returns all records from the right table and matched records from the left table. Unmatched records from the left table are `NULL`.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
RIGHT JOIN TableB ON TableA.CommonColumn = TableB.CommonColumn;
```

#### Example

Retrieve all course offerings including ones not yet assigned to faculty.

```sql
SELECT O.OfferNo, O.CourseNo, F.FacFirstName, F.FacLastName
FROM Offering AS O
RIGHT JOIN Faculty AS F ON O.FacNo = F.FacNo;
```

---

### 5. Full (Outer) Join

#### Description

Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table. Records without a match in the other table will have `NULL`.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
FULL OUTER JOIN TableB ON TableA.CommonColumn = TableB.CommonColumn;
```

#### Example

List all faculty and all offerings, matched when possible.

```sql
SELECT F.FacNo, F.FacFirstName, O.OfferNo, O.CourseNo
FROM Faculty AS F
FULL OUTER JOIN Offering AS O ON F.FacNo = O.FacNo;
```

---

### 6. Cross Join

#### Description

Returns the Cartesian product of the tables involved (every combination of rows).

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM TableA
CROSS JOIN TableB;
```

#### Example

Pair every faculty member with every course.

```sql
SELECT F.FacFirstName, F.FacLastName, C.CourseNo, C.CourseName
FROM Faculty AS F
CROSS JOIN Course AS C;
```

#### Note

- Results in a large dataset (number of rows in TableA * number of rows in TableB).
- Use with caution due to potential performance issues.

---

### 7. Self Join

#### Description

Joins a table to itself to compare rows within the same table.

#### Syntax

```sql
SELECT A.column, B.column
FROM Table AS A
JOIN Table AS B ON A.CommonColumn = B.CommonColumn;
```

#### Example

Find pairs of students with the same major.

```sql
SELECT S1.StudName AS Student1, S2.StudName AS Student2, S1.Major
FROM Student AS S1
JOIN Student AS S2 ON S1.Major = S2.Major
WHERE S1.StudNo < S2.StudNo;
```

---

## Conclusion

Understanding and effectively using different types of joins is fundamental in SQL. By mastering inner joins, natural joins, left joins, cross joins, and other types, you can retrieve and analyze data across multiple tables accurately.
