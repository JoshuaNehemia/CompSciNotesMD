## ⚙️ **Operational Databases**  
Operational databases serve as the **raw material** for management decision-making.  

### 🔹 **Why Are They Important?**  
- **Faster processing** ⚡  
- **Handles large volumes** of business transactions 📈  
- **Reduces personnel costs** 💼  

Operational databases provide **exception reports** and **problem notifications** for lower-level management.  
However, **middle and upper management** need **summarized and integrated data** for better decision-making.  

✅ **Strategic decision-making** also requires **external data sources** such as **industry & government datasets**.

# 🏛 **What is a Data Warehouse?**  
A **Data Warehouse** (coined by **William Inmon in 1990**) is a **logically centralized data repository** that integrates, cleans, and standardizes data from various sources to **support business intelligence (BI)**.  

### 🔹 **Key Benefits of a Data Warehouse**  
✔ **Integrates & cleans data** for better analysis 🔄  
✔ **Supports business intelligence & decision-making** 🧠  
✔ **Provides historical data insights** ⏳  
✔ **Enables data-driven strategies** 📊  

📌 **Tangible Benefits:**  
- 📉 **Fraud Detection** → Reduces financial losses  
- 🎯 **Targeted Marketing** → Improves customer retention  
- 📦 **Demand Forecasting** → Optimizes inventory levels

## 🔍 **Operational Databases vs. Data Warehouses**  

| Feature | Operational Database | Data Warehouse |
|---------|----------------------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Transaction processing | Business intelligence & analytics |
| **Data Type** | Current data 📅 | Historical & summarized data 📊 |
| **Granularity** | Individual-level records 👤 | Aggregated & detailed levels 📊 |
| **Query Scope** | Short transactions ⚡ | Complex analytical queries 🔍 |
| **Processing Time** | Real-time | Batch processing (Non-peak hours) |

📌 **Key Difference:**  
- **Operational Databases** → Handle **real-time transactions** (e.g., ATM withdrawals, order processing).  
- **Data Warehouses** → Handle **large-scale analytical queries** (e.g., sales trends, market forecasting).  

🔹 A **transaction** typically **updates a few records**, while a **BI query** may process **millions of records**.  
🔹 Data warehouses **utilize non-peak hours** for **data transformations & integration**.
