## Introduction

Welcome to **Lesson 1 of Module 5** on **Extended Query Formulation with SQL**. In this lesson, we'll delve into advanced strategies for SQL query formulation, enhancing your problem-solving skills to tackle more realistic and complex queries.

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- Utilize **critical questions** to analyze and dissect problem statements before writing SQL `SELECT` statements.
- Convert unstructured problem narratives into structured database representations involving tables, columns, and join conditions.
- Identify and eliminate **extra tables** in `SELECT` statements to optimize query performance.

---

## Understanding the Query Formulation Process

Query formulation involves transforming an unstructured problem statement into a structured **SQL statement**. This process can be visualized as:

```
Problem Statement (Unstructured) ➔ Database Representation ➔ SQL Statement
```

- **Problem Statement**: Often ambiguous, incomplete, and containing extraneous details.
- **Database Representation**: Structured identification of tables, columns, and relationships.
- **SQL Statement**: The actual query executed against the database.

**Key Challenge**: Converting the unstructured problem statement into a database representation requires:

- Detailed knowledge of the database schema.
- Careful attention to ambiguities and nuances in the problem statement.

---

## The Critical Questions in Query Formulation

To systematize the conversion process, we use three **critical questions**:

### 1. Identifying Required Tables and Columns

**Question**: *What tables and columns are needed to produce the desired output and satisfy the conditions?*

- **Steps**:
  - Match data requirements to specific columns.
  - Identify tables containing these columns.
  - Consider intermediate tables needed to connect related tables.

**Tip**: All tables involved must appear in the `FROM` clause of the SQL statement.

### 2. Determining How Tables are Joined

**Question**: *How are the tables related, and how should they be joined?*

- **Steps**:
  - Identify primary key and foreign key relationships.
  - Determine join conditions based on these relationships.
  - Use appropriate join types (usually `INNER JOIN`).

### 3. Recognizing the Need for Aggregation

**Question**: *Does the problem involve aggregate computations or grouping of data?*

- **Indicators**:
  - Use of words like **average**, **sum**, **count**, **minimum**, **maximum**.
  - Conditions involving aggregates (e.g., "offerings with more than 30 students").
  - Requirements for data summarization.

**Implications**:

- **Aggregate Functions**: `AVG()`, `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, `MIN()`, `MAX()`.
- **Grouping**: Use of the `GROUP BY` clause.
- **Group Conditions**: Use of the `HAVING` clause.

---

## Using Database Diagrams as a Tool

A **database diagram** is invaluable for:

- Visualizing table relationships.
- Identifying direct and indirect connections between tables.
- Planning join operations.

**Example**:

- **Tables**: `Student`, `Enrollment`, `Offering`.
- **Relationships**:
  - `Student` ←→ `Enrollment` ←→ `Offering`.
- **Note**: There is no direct link between `Student` and `Offering`; they are connected through `Enrollment`.

---

## Applying the Query Formulation Process: Examples

Let's apply the critical questions to real-world examples.

### Example 1: Counting Students Enrolled in Each Offering in Fall 2019

**Problem Statement**:

*For each course offering in Fall 2019, list the offering number and the number of students enrolled in the offering.*

#### Step 1: Identify Required Tables and Columns

- **Tables**:
  - `Offering`: Contains `OfferNo`, `OffTerm`, `OffYear`.
  - `Enrollment`: Contains `OfferNo` (foreign key), `StudNo` (student number).
- **Columns**:
  - `OfferNo` (from `Offering`).
  - Count of students (`COUNT(*)` on `Enrollment`).

#### Step 2: Determine How Tables are Joined

- **Join Condition**:
  - `Offering.OfferNo = Enrollment.OfferNo` (primary key and foreign key relationship).

#### Step 3: Recognize the Need for Aggregation

- **Aggregation**:
  - Counting the number of enrollments per offering.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY` on `Offering.OfferNo`.

#### SQL Statement

```sql
SELECT Offering.OfferNo, COUNT(*) AS NumStudents
FROM Offering, Enrollment
WHERE Offering.OfferNo = Enrollment.OfferNo
  AND OffTerm = 'FALL'
  AND OffYear = 2019
GROUP BY Offering.OfferNo;
```

#### Explanation

- **FROM Clause**: Includes `Offering` and `Enrollment` tables.
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Joins tables on `OfferNo`.
  - Filters offerings to Fall 2019.
- **GROUP BY Clause**: Groups results by `OfferNo`.
- **SELECT Clause**: Retrieves the `OfferNo` and counts the number of students.

#### Result

- **Output**: A list of offering numbers and the corresponding number of students enrolled in each.

---

### Example 2: Average GPA for Offerings with Average GPA Above 3.0

**Problem Statement**:

*For each course offering, list the offering number, course number, and the average GPA of students enrolled in the offering, but only for offerings where the average GPA is greater than 3.0.*

#### Step 1: Identify Required Tables and Columns

- **Tables**:
  - `Offering`: Contains `OfferNo`, `CourseNo`.
  - `Enrollment`: Contains `OfferNo`, `StudNo`.
  - `Student`: Contains `StudNo`, `StudGPA`.
- **Columns**:
  - `Offering.OfferNo`
  - `Offering.CourseNo`
  - `AVG(Student.StudGPA)`

#### Step 2: Determine How Tables are Joined

- **Join Conditions**:
  - `Offering.OfferNo = Enrollment.OfferNo`
  - `Enrollment.StudNo = Student.StudNo`

#### Step 3: Recognize the Need for Aggregation

- **Aggregation**:
  - Calculating the average GPA per offering.
- **Grouping**:
  - `GROUP BY` on `Offering.OfferNo`, `Offering.CourseNo`.
- **Group Condition**:
  - `HAVING AVG(Student.StudGPA) > 3.0`

#### SQL Statement

```sql
SELECT Offering.OfferNo, Offering.CourseNo, AVG(Student.StudGPA) AS AvgGPA
FROM Offering, Enrollment, Student
WHERE Offering.OfferNo = Enrollment.OfferNo
  AND Enrollment.StudNo = Student.StudNo
GROUP BY Offering.OfferNo, Offering.CourseNo
HAVING AVG(Student.StudGPA) > 3.0;
```

#### Explanation

- **FROM Clause**: Includes `Offering`, `Enrollment`, and `Student` tables.
- **WHERE Clause**:
  - Joins tables on `OfferNo` and `StudNo`.
- **GROUP BY Clause**: Groups results by `OfferNo` and `CourseNo`.
- **HAVING Clause**: Filters groups with an average GPA greater than 3.0.
- **SELECT Clause**: Retrieves the offering number, course number, and average GPA.

#### Result

- **Output**: Offerings where the average GPA of enrolled students exceeds 3.0, along with offering and course numbers.

## Efficiency Considerations and Avoiding Extra Tables

While modern SQL compilers optimize queries, including unnecessary tables can:

- **Decrease Performance**: Extra tables require additional resources to retrieve and process data.
- **Cause Confusion**: More complexity in the query may lead to errors and misinterpretations.

### Example 3: The Impact of Extra Tables

Suppose we modify **Example 2** to include the `Course` table, even though it's not needed.

#### Modified SQL Statement

```sql
SELECT Offering.OfferNo, Offering.CourseNo, AVG(Student.StudGPA) AS AvgGPA
FROM Offering, Enrollment, Student, Course
WHERE Offering.OfferNo = Enrollment.OfferNo
  AND Enrollment.StudNo = Student.StudNo
GROUP BY Offering.OfferNo, Offering.CourseNo
HAVING AVG(Student.StudGPA) > 3.0;
```

#### Issues

- **Extra Table**: `Course` is included in the `FROM` clause but not used.
- **Performance Impact**: Query execution slows down due to unnecessary data retrieval.
- **Result**: Same as Example 2 but less efficient.

#### Lesson

- **Avoid Extra Tables**: Only include tables that contribute to the result or conditions.
- **Check Your Query**: Review the `FROM` clause for any redundant tables.
