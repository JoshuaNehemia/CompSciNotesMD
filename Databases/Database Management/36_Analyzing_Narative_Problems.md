# Lesson 2: Guidelines for Analyzing Narrative Problems in Conceptual Data Modeling

---

## Objectives of Narrative Problem Analysis

1. **Goals**:
   - Create an **ERD** consistent with the problem narrative.
   - Ensure the ERD aligns with both direct and implied elements in the narrative.
   - Detect and address limitations, such as:
     - Missing details (e.g., cardinality requirements).
     - Ambiguity (e.g., unclear attributes).
     - Inconsistencies (e.g., conflicting statements about relationships).

2. **Simplicity Principle**:
   - Favor **simpler designs** initially.
   - Examples:
     - Prefer an attribute over an entity type unless additional details justify otherwise.
   - Refine and add complexities during later stages of design.

3. **Steps**:
   - **Step 1: Identify Entity Types**:
     - Extract **nouns** representing people, things, places, and events.
     - Example: In "students take courses," `Student` and `Course` are potential entity types.
   - **Step 2: Determine Attributes**:
     - Identify properties that describe the entity types.
     - Example: In "students choose their major," `Major` is an attribute of the `Student` entity type.
   - **Step 3: Connect Entities and Specify Cardinalities**:
     - Establish relationships and cardinalities based on verbs or connections in the narrative.
     - Example: In "students enroll in courses," the relationship "EnrollsIn" is between `Student` and `Course`.

## Guidelines for Simplicity in Entity and Attribute Identification

1. **Entity Types**:
   - Look for **central nouns** that are subjects or objects in the narrative.
   - Example: In "students take courses," `Student` and `Course` are entity types.

2. **Attributes**:
   - Descriptive properties (e.g., names, dates, addresses).
   - Example: In "courses have a course number and room," `CourseNo` and `Room` are attributes of `Course`.

3. **When to Choose Attributes Over Entities**:
   - Default to attributes unless the narrative provides additional details about the noun.
   - Example:
     - `InstructorName` in "courses list instructor names" should be an attribute unless details about instructors (e.g., office, phone) are provided.

4. **Primary Key Selection**:
   - Criteria:
     - **Stability**: Should not change over time.
       - Avoid: Phone numbers, email addresses.
     - **Single-Purpose**: Should only be for identification.
       - Avoid: Bank routing numbers or Social Security numbers.

## Relationship Identification and Cardinality Specification

1. **Relationships**:
   - Typically appear as **verbs** linking nouns (entity types).
   - Example: In "students enroll in courses," "EnrollsIn" is the relationship.

2. **Maximum Cardinality**:
   - Derived from nouns and context.
   - Example: In "a course contains a collection of students," the term "collection" implies "many."

3. **Minimum Cardinality**:
   - Keywords like "optional" and "required" help specify:
     - Default: Mandatory (minimum cardinality = 1).
     - Example: "An instructor teaches courses" implies one instructor per course (minimum = 1).

## Application Example: Water Utility Database

**Narrative**:
- The database must track **customers**, **meters**, **bills**, and **rates**.
- Relationships described include:
  - A customer has many meters.
  - Meters are periodically read to record water usage.
  - Bills are generated for customers based on readings.

### Extracted Information:
1. **Entity Types**:
   - `Customer`, `Meter`, `Bill`, `Rate`.
2. **Attributes**:
   - `Customer` → `CustNo` (PK), `Name`, `Address`.
   - `Meter` → `MeterNo` (PK).
   - `Bill` → `BillNo` (PK).
   - `Rate` → `RateNo` (PK).
3. **Relationships**:
   - **Assigned**:
     - Relationship: `Customer → Rate`.
     - Cardinalities: Many customers → One rate.
   - **Uses**:
     - Relationship: `Customer → Meter`.
     - Cardinalities: One customer → Many meters.
   - **ReadBy**:
     - Relationship: `Meter → Reading`.
     - Cardinalities: One meter → Many readings.
   - **Includes**:
     - Relationship: `Bill → Reading`.
     - Cardinalities: One bill → Many readings.
   - **SentTo**:
     - Relationship: `Bill → Customer`.
     - Cardinalities: Many bills → One customer.

### **Navigating Ambiguity and Structure in Problem Statements**
1. **Identifying Deficiencies**:
   - Problem statements often lack full clarity or omit critical details, such as cardinality constraints or attribute definitions.
   - During analysis:
     - Ask clarifying questions or conduct additional requirements collection for missing or ambiguous parts.
     - Example: If the narrative says "orders are processed," but does not specify the exact relationship with customers or employees, you must probe further to determine whether it's a **direct** or **indirect connection**.

2. **Framing Simpler Designs**:
   - Simpler models avoid unnecessary complexities, making future refinements more manageable.
   - Techniques to simplify:
     - Use **Hub-and-Spoke Patterns**:
       - Place **Hub Entities** (e.g., Orders, Bills) at the center of ERDs to reduce the total number of relationships.
     - Treat uncertain nouns as **attributes** initially:
       - Reassess their role only if additional context suggests otherwise.

3. **Using Specialized Relationships Sparingly**:
   - Only incorporate **self-referencing**, **many-to-many**, or **weak entity** relationships when explicitly needed.
   - Avoid overcomplicating the model unless business rules demand these structures.

### **Applying Consistency with Narratives**
1. **Consistency Goal**:
   - Your ERD must match all narrative statements, whether explicitly stated or implied.
   - Do not allow personal experience or assumptions to override the narrative details.
     - Example: If the narrative states "each product has a unique code," ensure this is modeled as a primary key (`ProdNo`) and avoid using your own assumptions about product identifiers.
  
2. **Alignment with Cardinality and Attributes**:
   - Verify that **relationships** reflect correct constraints:
     - Singular nouns or phrases like "one" imply **1:1 or 1:M** relationships.
     - Terms like "collection," "set," or "many" indicate **M:N** or **M:1** relationships.
   - Attributes:
     - Map each attribute to its corresponding entity type as described in the narrative.

---

### **Common Pitfalls to Avoid**
1. **Conflict with Problem Narratives**:
   - Students often inadvertently introduce design errors by overriding the narrative with their own assumptions.
   - If a conflict arises:
     - Follow the narrative, even if it seems counterintuitive or differs from your expectations.

2. **Over-Modeling**:
   - Avoid modeling **every detail** prematurely. Begin with essential structures:
     - Example: Model "Course" as an entity type with `CourseNo` as a primary key and add relationships or attributes like `InstructorName` only when additional data supports their inclusion.

3. **Skipping Requirements Validation**:
   - Always validate your model against real-world context or additional requirements.
   - While the narrative defines the framework, nuanced details often emerge during stakeholder discussions.

### **Practical Example: Water Utility Database**
- **Deficiencies in Problem Statement**:
  - Does not clarify minimum cardinalities for relationships like `Includes` (between Bill and Reading).
  - May omit constraints for relationships between `Customer` and `Rate`.
- **Simplification Techniques**:
  - Place `Bill` as a **Hub Entity** connecting directly to `Customer`, `Reading`, and `Rate`.
  - Treat rarely-changing attributes (e.g., `CustName`, `RateNo`) as attributes unless further details suggest otherwise.
- **Consistency Check**:
  - Ensure cardinalities specified in the ERD match narrative phrases like "a customer includes a collection of meters" (1:M relationship).

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Simplify First**:
   - Adopt the simplest model structure that satisfies the narrative, refining later as needed.
2. **Stick to the Narrative**:
   - A consistent design is one that aligns with narrative statements about attributes, relationships, and constraints, even if it conflicts with personal assumptions.
3. **Precise Use of Notation**:
   - Pay close attention to cardinality symbols and avoid redundant or unnecessary relationships.
4. **Refinement Is Iterative**:
   - Early designs need not be perfect; they should provide a functional foundation to add complexity as needed.
