# DBMS Overview and Database Definition Feature

## DBMS
DBMS is a collection of components that supports the creation, use, and maintenance of databases.

Initially, DBMS was designed to provide efficient storage and retrieval of data. However, as DBMS technology continues to evolve, it is crucial to continually update your knowledge.

## Enterprise DBMS
Enterprise DBMSs use servers running Linux (various versions), IBM MVS operating system, and Microsoft Windows Server operating systems.

Enterprise product versions support organizations with:
- Very large databases
- Thousands of simultaneous users
- Strong reliability and performance requirements

**Leading Enterprise DBMS Providers:**
- Oracle (leading provider)
- IBM
- Microsoft
- SAP
- Teradata
- Open-source products (e.g., PostgreSQL)

## Embedded DBMS
Embedded DBMS software is primarily sold by value-added software resellers as part of an application, such as an accounting package. 

### Features of Embedded DBMS:
- Hidden from users
- Requires little or no ongoing maintenance

## Database Definition
Database requires intensive planning to ensure efficiency and reliability.

## Structured Query Language (SQL)
SQL is a standard language used to interact with databases.

### SQL Capabilities:
- **Create Table Statement**: Defines tables and relationships using a structured language.
- **Industry Standard**: SQL provides a loose standard for the database software industry.

## DBMS Graphical Tools
Graphical tools help in designing and managing databases efficiently.

### Advantages:
- Not portable across all database software but easier to use.
- Allows users to create diagrams for better communication compared to SQL statements.
- Provides a visual representation of interrelated characteristics of databases, showing entity relationships.

## Importance of Database Planning
One key distinguishing feature of database software compared to standard desktop software is the need to define and plan database details before building and using it.

### Planning Considerations:
- Database structure can be refined after deployment, but **initial planning is essential**.
- Planning is often a **labor-intensive process** but ensures long-term efficiency and scalability.
