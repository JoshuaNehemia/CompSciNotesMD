# 🏦 Transaction Processing in DBMS  

## 📌 What is a Transaction in DBMS?  
A **transaction** in a Database Management System (DBMS) is a **logical unit of work** that consists of **one or more database operations** (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT).  

### ✅ **Key Characteristics of a Transaction**  
- **Atomic** → A transaction **must be completed fully** or **rolled back** if an error occurs.  
- **Reliable** → Ensures **data consistency** even in **multi-user** environments.  
- **Secure** → Prevents **partial updates** that could lead to **data corruption**.  

📌 **Example:** Transferring money between two bank accounts involves:  
1. Deducting money from **Account A**  
2. Adding money to **Account B**  
3. **Ensuring both operations succeed together**  

If any step fails, the transaction is **rolled back** to its original state.

## 🔄 **Transaction Lifecycle (Processing Steps)**  

### **1️⃣ Transaction Start**  
- The transaction begins when a **user or application** initiates a database operation.  
- Example: A customer **initiates a money transfer** via an online banking system.  

---

### **2️⃣ Execution of Database Operations**  
The transaction performs **read/write** operations on the database. 

### 3️⃣ Validation & Concurrency Control
The DBMS checks constraints to ensure data consistency.
If multiple transactions are executing, locking mechanisms prevent conflicts.

### 4️⃣ Commit or Rollback
✅ Successful Transaction → COMMIT
- If all operations succeed, changes are saved permanently.
❌ Failure → ROLLBACK
- If any operation fails, the DBMS undoes all changes to maintain consistency.

## 🛡 ACID Properties of Transactions
To ensure data reliability and integrity, DBMS transactions follow ACID properties:

| ACID Property	| Description |
|---------------|-------------|
|Atomicity 🧩 |	All or nothing – either the entire transaction happens or none of it does. |
|Consistency 📊	| Ensures the database remains valid before and after a transaction. |
|Isolation 🔒| 	Prevents concurrent transactions from interfering with each other. |
|Durability 💾	| Once a transaction is committed, changes remain permanent even after system failures. |

### 📌 Why is ACID important?
Without ACID properties, a database could become corrupt, leading to data loss or inconsistent information.
