# **Hypothesis Testing**

Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to evaluate and compare assumptions about population parameters based on sample data. A key component of hypothesis testing in many contexts is assessing **normality** and, if needed, **normalizing the data**.

## **Normality Test**

Normality tests are performed to determine whether a dataset follows a normal distribution, which is a common assumption for many statistical tests.

### **Types of Normality Tests**

1. **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test (KS Test)**
   - Compares the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF) of the sample data with the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of a specified distribution (e.g., normal distribution).
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: The data follows the specified distribution.
   - **Example Output**: A small \(p\)-value (\(p \leq \alpha\)) suggests that the data is not normally distributed.

2. **Cramer-Von Mises Test**
   - A statistical test that evaluates the goodness-of-fit of a dataset to a specified distribution by considering the squared difference between the ECDF and the CDF.
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: The data follows the specified distribution.
   - Particularly useful for detecting discrepancies in the tails of the distribution.

3. **Anderson-Darling Test**
   - Enhances the Cramer-Von Mises test by weighting discrepancies in the tails of the distribution more heavily.
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: The data follows a specified distribution.
   - Results include a test statistic and critical values. If the statistic exceeds the critical value, \(H_0\) is rejected.

4. **Chi-Squared Goodness-of-Fit Test**
   - Compares the observed frequency of data to the expected frequency under a specified distribution.
   - **Null Hypothesis (\(H_0\))**: The data follows the specified distribution.
   - Requires binning data into discrete categories, making it suitable for larger sample sizes.

## **Normalizing Data**

If a dataset is not normally distributed, normalization techniques can be applied to transform the data to approximate normality.

### **Methods for Normalizing Data**

1. **Box-Cox Transformation**
   - A power transformation that stabilizes variance and makes data more normally distributed.
   - Formula:
     $$
     y(\lambda) =
     \begin{cases}
     \frac{(x^\lambda - 1)}{\lambda}, & \text{if } \lambda \neq 0, \\
     \ln(x), & \text{if } \lambda = 0
     \end{cases}
     $$
   - Where:
     - \(x\): Original data.
     - \(\lambda\): Transformation parameter.

   - Commonly applied to positive data values.

2. **Grouping**
   - Binning continuous data into discrete categories to reduce the effect of skewness or non-normal patterns.
   - Example: Grouping ages into bins like 0–10, 11–20, etc., can help approximate normality by simplifying the dataset.

### **Importance of Normality Tests and Normalization**
1. **Statistical Test Validity**:
   - Many statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, ANOVA) assume normality. Violations of this assumption can lead to unreliable results.
2. **Improved Model Performance**:
   - In predictive modeling, normalizing data can improve the performance of models sensitive to skewed distributions (e.g., linear regression).
3. **Practical Applications**:
   - Normalizing financial data, biological measurements, or survey responses ensures that statistical methods are applied correctly.
