## SOC Ticketing System

### What is SOC Ticketing System?
A **Security Operations Center (SOC) Ticketing System** is a platform used to manage, track, and document security incidents. It helps SOC teams efficiently handle cybersecurity threats and streamline incident response.

### Why is SOC Ticketing Important?
- **Tracks all security events** for proper documentation.
- **Prioritizes alerts** (Critical, High, Medium, Low) based on severity.
- **Ensures proper escalation** to the right SOC tier (T1, T2, T3).
- **Maintains compliance** with security policies and audit requirements.
- **Facilitates collaboration** between SOC teams, IT, Legal, and HR.

### Key Features of SOC Ticketing System
1. **Automated Ticket Creation**
   - Integrated with SIEM, IDS, and EDR tools to detect and log incidents automatically.
   
2. **Categorization & Prioritization**
   - Incidents classified into categories like Phishing, Malware, Insider Threats, etc.
   - Prioritization based on severity and potential impact.

3. **Assignment & Escalation**
   - Tier 1: Initial triage, determine false positives.
   - Tier 2: Deep investigation, impact analysis.
   - Tier 3: Advanced threat hunting, forensic analysis.

4. **Incident Response Workflow**
   - Containment → Eradication → Recovery → Lessons Learned.

5. **Audit & Compliance Logs**
   - Ensures adherence to security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001, GDPR, etc.).
   
6. **Collaboration Tools**
   - Integration with IT, Legal, and HR for coordinated incident management.

### Conclusion
A well-implemented SOC ticketing system enhances efficiency, accountability, and security incident response within an organization. It ensures a structured approach to handling cybersecurity threats effectively.
